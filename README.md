## Research 

### Business/Customers

●	What problem will your Computer Vision solution solve, and for whom?

○	 As we very well know, accidents have become very common. Our motive here is to create a software that is beneficial for pedestrian crossing to avoid unnecessary accidents. This is for the people of Davidson County who need a software that monitors the pedestrian walks using a camera and identifies and alerts potential accidents using the statistics of previous accidents.

●	 What value will it provide them? What are their pain points? 

○	Value: Outcome of this software would help to avoid accidents and hence would be an accessory for the humans to ensure safety.
○	Pain: The process of not just collecting statistics about the area but also predicting and warning the people would be a big challenge as many may just stand in the pedestrian crosswalk without crossing (just to have a chat) and a few may be intending to cross. Hence, predicting their intent would be a challenge so we must analyse their movement to know that they are going to cross the road.

●	How big is the potential market? 

○	The market for this sort of technology is super wide. This software that we are developing can be implemented in all pedestrian crosswalks throughout the world.


### OPEN SOURCE:

● What open source code is available that is relevant to your topic? 

○ There is a large codebase for pedestrian safety based models like https://github.com/anjali-chadha/pedestrian-safety-computer-vision , https://github.com/topics/pedestrian-safety. 

● How active are the communities around this code? 

○ Not particularly active.  There are a few changes and fixes made occasionally, but they are not many contributors.

● What data is available for testing and/or training algorithms? 

○ Raw Data - link to the data set from our google drive(collected from various resources, put together


### INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS:

● What companies are solving similar problems to yours? 

○  Data from sky is a company that solves such problems using AI.

● It can be tough to tell exactly how proprietary solutions work, but what can you find on the internet? 

○ Tracking people from video footage isn’t cutting-edge technology, but prediction by sensing the movements and warning would be a bit on the harder side and there isn’t a lot on the internet regarding this topic.
